gain:
  type:
    dtype: str
    default: complex
    choices:
      - complex
      - diag_complex
      - amplitude
      - delay
      - delay_and_offset
      - delay_and_tec
      - phase
      - tec_and_offset
      - rotation_measure
      - rotation
      - crosshand_phase
      - crosshand_phase_null_v
      - leakage
      - parallactic_angle
      - feed_flip
    info:
      Type of gain to solve for.

  solve_per:
    dtype: str
    default: antenna
    choices: [antenna, array]
    info:
      Determines whether this term should be solved per antenna (conventional)
      or over the entire array (doesn't vary with antenna).

  direction_dependent:
    dtype: bool
    default: False
    info:
      Determines whether this term is treated as direction dependent.

  pinned_directions:
    dtype: List[int]
    default: [0]
    info:
      If this term is direction dependent, this can be used to exclude
      integer indexed directions during gain updates i.e. effectively disable
      updates in the given directions. Accepts a list of integer values e.g.
      '[0,3]'.

  time_interval:
    dtype: str
    default: "1"
    info:
      Number of timeslots/amount of time to include in a single solution.
      Specify as an integer number of timeslots, or a value with a unit
      (e.g. '300s'). 0 means use full time axis.

  freq_interval:
    dtype: str
    default: "1"
    info:
      Number of channels/bandwidth to include in a single solution. Specify as
      an integer number of channels, or a value with a unit (e.g. '128MHz').
      0 means use full frequency axis.

  load_from:
    dtype: Optional[str]
    info:
      Load solutions from given database.

  interp_mode:
    dtype: str
    default: reim
    choices: [reim, ampphase, amp, phase]
    info:
      Set interpolation mode. THIS OPTION IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE.

  interp_method:
    dtype: str
    default: "2dlinear"
    choices: ["2dlinear", "2dspline"]
    info:
      Set interpolation method.

  respect_scan_boundaries:
    dtype: bool
    default: true
    info: Determines whether solution intervals may span multiple scans. This
          only works when input_ms.group_by does not include SCAN_NUMBER. Can
          be used in conjunction with time_interval to solve a term per scan
          even when data is not partitioned by scan (by setting this to True
          and time_interval to 0).

  initial_estimate:
    dtype: bool
    default: false
    info: Controls whether or not a term will be populated with an initial
          estimiate where applicable. Currently only supported for delay
          terms.
